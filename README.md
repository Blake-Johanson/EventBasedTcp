# Event Based TCP

In C#, TCPClient/TCPListener, and their sockets, are really hard to deal with. You can take so much time developing a client server system that works, but why not use a library that MORE than works?  
Being event based makes this library easy to use, and with it's AutoResponse capabilities, and soon to be advanced logging, it'll be the best of the best!
